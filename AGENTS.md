# Requirements for Agents

## Technical Requirements

- Always use bun as the package manager. Never use npm or yarn.
- Use typescript and tailwindcss.
- Use biome as the linter and formatter, run `bun run lint/format/check` after you finish implementing a feature. Fix any issues found.
- You can install new dependencies with bun as you want, but you need to ask for permission first.
